# Open debug
This script is made to find and open the latest _debug.txt_

### What solved this?
With running [robot framework](https://robotframework.org/) tests a debug file can be made.

While tests run every log/print will be written to this file.

However with developing and testing your own work opening this debug file is a hassle.

This script opens the latest updated debug file.
