# Capture screen
### What does this do?
As the name suggests these python files can be used to capture the screen of the computer.

Useful to run computer vision programs on the captured frames.

### Which one should i choose?
There are two scripts, both doing basically the same.

One is made with multiprocessing, the other uses threading.

Multiprocessing works on Linux but not on Windows.

Threading works on Windows but not on Linux.

I don't know why.
