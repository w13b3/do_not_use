# Dummy popup
### What does this do?
This shows a popup on the lower right of the screen.

[popup.png](popup.png) is provided as example.

Run the script as is and it looks like a remote teamviewer session is using the computer.

The popup stays always on top of other windows.

The popup can be closed by pressing the X, like a real program. This also stops the script.
